      "However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernize the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinized, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. They shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut. The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Another high-profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company. Although he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr. Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke. Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\n"

      "Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernize the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal.

The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. The pair both worked at Bank of China in the northern city of Harbin, the South China Morning Post reported. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder.\n"
