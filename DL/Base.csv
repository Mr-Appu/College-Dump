334,"Japanese Fish Found in Tsunami Debris Highlights the Impact of Ocean Pollution Oregon authorities have reported the discovery of a Japanese species of fish inside a floating vessel, one of the latest of one million tons of debris dispersed in the Pacific Ocean by the catastrophic tsunami that struck Japan in 2011. The authorities plan to tow the 25-ft piece of fiberglass, significantly highlighting the ongoing impact of ocean pollution. The tsunami, triggered by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake, claimed the lives of 18,000 people with powerful waves reaching heights of 128 feet above sea level. A vast amount of debris, including fragments of destroyed cities and infrastructure, was left scattered across the Pacific, causing severe damage to marine ecosystems. This latest discovery showcases the immense scale of the issue and the urgent need for increased efforts to mitigate ocean pollution. The inclusion of a Japanese fish species within the debris is a stark reminder of the interconnectivity of marine ecosystems and the potential for invasive species to be introduced to new habitats as a consequence of pollution. Efforts by authorities have so far resulted in the recovery of tons of debris, including the removal of one 178-ton dock that washed onto the Oregon coast in 2012. However, the challenge remains immense, as the vast majority of the debris remains unaccounted for. With considerable amounts of plastics and microplastics now known to be present throughout the oceans, the race is on to better understand and respond to the multiple threats that our seas face. The Oregon authorities have announced plans to tow the 25-ft piece of fiberglass for further study and eventual disposal, while continuing their efforts to locate and remove other significant pieces of tsunami debris. As investigations deepen, it becomes increasingly crucial to confront the growing issue of ocean pollution and protect the delicate balance of marine ecosystems worldwide.",0,cnn_gpt4,0

1435,"Pharmacotherapy for Fibromyalgia: An Update Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in localized areas. The treatment of fibromyalgia mainly focuses on managing symptoms and improving the overall quality of life. Pharmacotherapy for fibromyalgia has evolved over the years, currently incorporating both traditional and newer medications. Here is an update on the latest advancements and options in pharmacotherapy for fibromyalgia. 1. Approved medications The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following medications specifically for the treatment of fibromyalgia: - Pregabalin (Lyrica): Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant and a central nervous system depressant used to manage neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and partial onset seizures. Pregabalin is believed to act on the -2- subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, thus controlling pain and improving sleep in fibromyalgia patients. - Duloxetine (Cymbalta): Duloxetine is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that alters the balance of these neurotransmitters in the brain, thereby reducing pain and improving mood in people with fibromyalgia. - Milnacipran (Savella): Milnacipran is another SNRI approved for fibromyalgia. It works similar to Duloxetine but with a higher selectivity for norepinephrine than serotonin. Milnacipran has been shown to improve pain, fatigue, and overall functioning in fibromyalgia patients. 2. Off-label medications Several off-label medications are frequently prescribed to manage fibromyalgia symptoms, including: - Antidepressants: Besides the approved SNRIs, other antidepressants, such as tricyclics (e.g., amitriptyline) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g., fluoxetine), have also been used to treat fibromyalgia symptoms. - Other anticonvulsants: Apart from pregabalin, gabapentin has shown some benefits in reducing pain, fatigue, and improving sleep quality in fibromyalgia patients. - Low-dose naltrexone: Although not approved for fibromyalgia, low-dose naltrexone has demonstrated promising results in reducing chronic pain and inflammation in certain cases. - Muscle relaxants, such as cyclobenzaprine, can help reduce muscle pain and improve sleep. 3. Emerging medications Research continues to explore new pharmacological treatments for fibromyalgia. Some medications currently under investigation include: - Cannabinoids: Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that cannabinoids (found in medical marijuana and CBD oil) hold potential for the treatment of fibromyalgia by reducing pain, inflammation, and improving sleep quality. - Mirogabalin: Similar to pregabalin, this novel drug targets the -2- subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. - NK1 receptor antagonists: These drugs, like serlopitant and orvepitant, target the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor, which mediates pain transmission, and may be useful in managing chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia. In conclusion, pharmacotherapy for fibromyalgia primarily focuses on the management of pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. While current medications provide relief for many patients, not all individuals with fibromyalgia respond to existing treatments, emphasizing the need for continued research and development in this field.",0,pubmed_gpt4,0
218,"Bucks Resident Builds Remarkable Observatory in Garden, Captures Stunning Images of the Solar System Over 40 years ago, Dave Tyler, a retired engineer from Buckinghamshire, decided to take his love for astronomy to new heights by building an incredible observatory right in his garden. Sitting in a peaceful corner of his Bucks home since 1977, Tyler's custom-built observatory captures breathtaking images of the solar system, delving deep into the cosmos by zooming in on intricate details of planets, solar flares, and sunspots, among others. Tyler, who shared pictures of his observatory for the first time this week, reveals that the idea of creating the space stemmed from his intense passion for astronomy. Always enthralled by the stars and celestial bodies typically out of our reach, he set out on a journey to study deep space phenomena from the comfort of his own home. Over four decades, Tyler has continuously upgraded his observatory with the latest state-of-the-art equipment.

311,"Yemeni Houthi rebels announced on Friday that fighters will not withdraw from major cities, as stated by the leader of the Iran-aligned Islamist movement. Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Houthi militia, said in a televised address that the fighters will not abide by the humanitarian ceasefire in the four-year-long war. ""The fighters will not move out, so long as there is no trust in the other parties who hold power. No retreat, no surrender!"" al-Houthi announced in his heavily guarded residence in the town of Al-Durayhimi, South of Hudaydah. The speech came moments after a breakthrough in the talks in Muscat, Oman. Saudi-led, UN-organized peace negotiations over the weekend, which brought Yemen's internationally recognized Yemeni Government and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels to the table, aimed to halt fighting in the flashpoint city of Hudaydah. However, the Yemeni government, which is backed by a US-supported Saudi-led coalition, has already staged a partial withdrawal. In another development today, Brigadier General Tariq Saleh pledged his support to Yemen's ousted President. Tariq, nephew of the slain ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh, emphasized in a statement released by his office that his fighters will focus on ""liberating the remaining cities under the control of Houthi militia."" The move emphasizes the divisions within the country, as the exiled President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his separatist rivals struggle for control over the Yemeni provinces as well as the capital Aden. The Yemen war has killed more than 10,000 people since 2015, many of them civilians, in an alarming humanitarian crisis in the Arab region's poorest country. The crisis intensified after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates led a coalition to overthrow the Iran-backed Houthi rebels who ousted the government-backed Hadi from Sana'a, Yemen's traditional capital. Iranian State TV has so far accused the Saudi-led coalition of numerous attacks on civilian targets such as markets and schools. The US, a key backer to the coalition, has been providing them with intelligence and logistical support but facing strong criticism by even its own officials. Despite the recent developments in peace talks, fighters remain on the strategic port city of Hudaydah, Yemen's fourth-largest city and a densely populated stronghold of the Houthi rebels. Al-Houthi also blamed the international community for ""holding back peace"" and failing to address the country's food crisis, energy, and water shortages faced by millions of Yemeni people today.",0,cnn_gpt4,0

1401,"The origin of life is a highly debated topic with various theories and hypotheses, one of which is the idea of a spatially localized stochastic transition. This concept suggests that the formation of life emerged in a particular location, essentially by chance, as a result of specific environmental conditions and molecular interactions. In this view, life's emergence is seen as a stochastic event, meaning that it is the outcome of random processes and the probability of it occurring could be very low. This perspective on the origin of life does not necessarily point to a single, universally agreed-upon mechanism but recognizes that particular spatial conditions and molecular interactions might have played a significant role in the development of living organisms. However, there are alternative theories for the origin of life, such as those involving extraterrestrial delivery of organic materials, deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments, or other non-stochastic chemical processes. The complex nature of life and the extensive timescales that preceded it makes this question challenging to answer definitively. Nonetheless, the idea of a spatially localized stochastic transition is one possible hypothesis for the emergence of life on Earth.",0,pubmed_gpt4,0
1542,"DNA barcoding works in practice as a tool for species identification and discovery, but there may be some discrepancies when it comes to neutral theory. In practice, DNA barcoding involves using a standardized fragment of DNA (usually a gene sequence that is highly conserved across different species) to differentiate and identify species. The method has been successful in addressing issues of species identification, discovering cryptic species, and in biodiversity assessments. On the other hand, neutral theory is a concept in evolutionary biology that suggests that genetic diversity within populations is mostly driven by genetic drift and mutation, rather than selection. In other words, most observed genetic variation is functionally neutral, i.e., it doesn't affect the fitness of an organism. In the context of DNA barcoding, neutral theory highlights potential issues with using conserved gene sequences for species identification because there may be significant variation in these sequences that is irrelevant to the species' functional characteristics. For this reason, DNA barcoding might not align perfectly with neutral theory, since it largely relies on the assumption that small genetic differences between the sequences being compared are sufficient to differentiate species. However, while this may be a theoretical limitation, DNA barcoding has been shown to be an effective tool in practice for many applications. Careful consideration in choosing appropriate DNA sequences for barcoding and understanding the limitations of the method are necessary for its continued success.",0,pubmed_gpt4,0

1417,"Yes, suicide substrates have been used to reveal properties of the homology-dependent steps during integrative recombination of bacteriophage lambda. These substrates, also known as ""suicide probes"" or ""suicide substrates,"" are chemically modified versions of the normal DNA substrates that are involved in recombination reactions. They are designed such that they can begin the recombination process but are unable to complete it, often due to chemical modifications that make them vulnerable to cleavage by restriction enzymes or other types of nucleases. By using suicide substrates in recombination experiments with the bacteriophage lambda system, researchers have been able to gain insights into the molecular details of the homology-dependent steps of the recombination process, such as the requirement for homologous DNA sequences, the role of protein-protein interactions, and the mechanism of strand exchange. For example, experiments using suicide substrates have shown that the lambda integrase protein mediates the initial pairing of homologous DNA sequences and that the presence of a homology-dependent DNA annealing activity is essential for the recombination process to occur. These studies have also revealed that other proteins, such as the lambda Xis protein and the host integration host factor (IHF) play critical roles in the process. In summary, suicide substrates have been valuable tools for studying the intricate molecular details of the homology-dependent steps during integrative recombination of bacteriophage lambda and has led to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in this essential biological process.",0,pubmed_gpt4,0

1406,"Stimulation threshold in intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) can affect the predictive value of the monitoring. The stimulation threshold is the minimum electrical stimulus required to elicit a response from a nerve. The predictive value of IONM depends on its sensitivity and specificity, which can vary depending on the stimulation threshold, technique used, and the type of surgery. Lower stimulation thresholds may help to identify nerves with greater accuracy, but there could be false positives, which could lower the specificity of IONM. On the other hand, higher stimulation thresholds could lead to potential nerve damage due to strong electrical stimulation. Several studies have shown varying results regarding the optimal stimulation threshold for intraoperative nerve monitoring. Some studies have suggested that higher stimulation thresholds help improve the specificity of IONM without sacrificing sensitivity, while others have found that lower stimulation thresholds might better predict postoperative nerve function. Thus, while stimulation threshold does affect the predictive value of intraoperative nerve monitoring, the optimal threshold setting may differ based on factors such as the type of surgery, technique used, and individual patient characteristics. A tailored approach to determining the stimulation threshold for each patient may help maximize the predictive value of IONM in preventing nerve injury during surgery.",0,pubmed_gpt4,0

1407,"Lesion of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway can lead to a variety of motor and sensory symptoms, but there is not much evidence directly linking it to the induction of trigeminal dynamic mechanical allodynia. Trigeminal dynamic mechanical allodynia refers to a painful sensation in the area innervated by the trigeminal nerve in response to a normally non-painful stimulus. Multiple neural pathways are involved in pain processing, including dopaminergic pathways, but lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway is more commonly associated with Parkinson's disease and motor symptoms rather than the specific induction of trigeminal allodynia. However, research on the relationship between dopaminergic pathways and pain processing is still ongoing; hence, a definitive answer is yet to be established. It is important to remember that pain, including trigeminal allodynia, is a complex and multifactorial experience, with various mechanisms and pathways potentially interacting and contributing to the development of painful symptoms.",0,pubmed_gpt4,0

1477,"A binary complex of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA-C) and adenosine could provide insights into conformational flexibility, but it may not necessarily further define it. PKA-C is known to undergo conformational changes upon binding to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and the presence of adenosine could potentially affect these conformational changes. However, the extent to which adenosine modulates this flexibility specifically in binary complexes is not well-established. Additionally, several other factors might lead to conformational flexibility, including the presence of other ligands, interactions with regulatory subunits, and post-translational modifications. To fully understand the role of adenosine in defining conformational flexibility, it may be necessary to evaluate the formation of the binary complex using biophysical techniques such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, or other techniques that provide structural information about protein-ligand interactions. Furthermore, computational studies such as molecular dynamics simulations or docking studies can also help investigate conformational flexibility in the presence of adenosine. In summary, while a binary complex of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and adenosine could potentially provide insights into conformational flexibility, further experimental and computational studies are needed to fully understand the role of adenosine in this process.",0,pubmed_gpt4,0
274,"Antigua, West Indies - England's premier fast bowler, James Anderson, stands on the brink of history as he prepares to earn his 100th Test cap on Monday, 28th January. As England faces the West Indies at the picturesque Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Ground, Anderson needs just four wickets to surpass Sir Ian Botham's national record of 383 Test wickets. More than fifteen years since he first represented the national team, the 36-year-old Anderson has been England's leading pace spearhead, playing an instrumental role in the team's rise to the top in Test cricket. Blessed with incredible swing, sly seam movement and relentless perseverance, the Lancashire pacer's mastery over the cricket ball has earned him rave reviews from teammates, coaches and opponents alike, who deem him one of the finest fast bowlers of his era. Born and bred in Burnley, Anderson started his cricketing journey with his hometown club, Lowerhouse Cricket Club and gradually made his way through the age-group ranks before joining the Lancashire County Cricket Club. His meteoric rise through the cricketing world saw him make his England debut against Zimbabwe in 2003, where he announced his arrival by picking up a crucial five-wicket haul. Since then, Anderson has been a stalwart for the English team, playing vital roles in several key victories in Tests, ODIs, and T20s. Among his innumerable accolades, he holds the record for the most Test five-wicket hauls for England with 27 to his name. Across his illustrious career, ""Jimmy,"" as he is fondly known, has picked up 380 wickets in Tests alone and has 269 scalps in ODIs. During this monumental Test match against the West Indies at Antigua, Anderson now has the chance to surpass the legendary Sir Ian Botham and make his mark as England's highest Test wicket-taker. Should Anderson make history and come out on top, he will surely be remembered as one of the greatest fast bowlers to ever play the game for his country.",0,cnn_gpt4,0
1495,"Surgical excision of heterotopic ossification (HO) can potentially lead to the re-emergence of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) populations responsible for recurrence. However, the exact mechanism and risk factors for recurrence after surgery are not yet fully understood. Heterotopic ossification is the abnormal formation of bone in soft tissues, often following trauma, surgery, or other inflammatory conditions. Mesenchymal stem cells play a key role in the process, as they can differentiate into various cell types, including osteoblasts, which are responsible for bone formation. During the surgical excision of HO, it is not uncommon for some of the surrounding tissues to be disrupted or damaged, which could lead to the stimulation and activation of local MSC populations. These activated MSCs may then differentiate into osteoblasts and contribute to the recurrence of HO. To minimize the risk of recurrence, a combination of treatments may be employed. For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or radiation therapy can be used pre- or post-operatively to inhibit the differentiation of MSCs and reduce the risk of HO formation. However, even with these interventions, recurrence can still occur in some cases. In summary, surgical excision of heterotopic ossification may lead to the re-emergence of mesenchymal stem cell populations responsible for recurrence. However, the precise mechanisms are not yet fully understood, and further studies are needed to determine the risk factors for recurrence and the most effective preventive strategies.",0,pubmed_gpt4,0
1404,"Yes, dopamine D2 receptor occupancy has been shown to correlate with catalepsy and the suppression of conditioned avoidance response behavior in rats. Many studies have investigated the role of dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in antipsychotic drug effects and have found that it significantly contributes to the suppression of certain behaviors, such as conditioned avoidance response. In these studies, rats are typically given different doses of antipsychotic drugs, which cause varying levels of D2 receptor occupancy. It has been observed that higher levels of receptor occupancy are more likely to result in cataleptic behavior and suppression of conditioned avoidance responses. These findings suggest that D2 receptor occupancy may be an important factor in understanding the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs. Further research is needed to fully understand the role D2 receptor occupancy plays in the therapeutic effects of these drugs and to optimize their usage in treating disorders such as schizophrenia.",0,pubmed_gpt4,0

331,"Dominic Solanke scores twice as Chelsea U19s defeat Roma in UEFA Youth League semi-final Chelsea's youth team advanced to the UEFA Youth League final last night after putting on an impressive display against Roma, winning 4-0. Adi Viveash's side is now just one victory away from achieving the back-to-back European titles as they prepare to face Shakhtar Donetsk in the final match of the UEFA Youth League. The star of the night was Dominic Solanke, the 18-year-old Chelsea youth striker who scored two fantastic goals and showcased his immense talent in front of an ecstatic crowd at the Cobham Training Centre. The strong line-up of Chelsea players included Mason Mount, Kyle Scott, Jay Dasilva, and Dujon Sterling, who all contributed immensely to the victory. Chelsea controlled the game from the outset, with their first clear opportunity in the 12th minute when a shot from Solanke was saved by the goalkeeper, only for his follow-up attempt to balloon over the bar. However, it didn't take long for the young Englishman to find the net, as he broke the deadlock in the 23rd minute with a powerful header from a brilliant cross by Charlie Wakefield. Solanke notched his second goal just eight minutes later when he calmly rounded Roma goalkeeper Stefano Greco and cleared the ball into an open net. Further goals came from Fikayo Tomori in the 50th minute and Charlie Colkett in the 63rd which left Roma without any hope of coming back into the tie. Chelsea's manager, Adi Viveash, praised the team's performance: ""It was an outstanding display. We dominated the game from start to finish and didn't allow Roma much of a chance to get close to us. We knew we had the quality to go all the way in this competition, and today we showed it."" Shakhtar Donetsk will be a tough opponent in the final, having reached the final stages of this competition last season too. Their semi-final victory over Anderlecht was impressive, coming back from 3-1 down to win 4-3, so Chelsea U19s have a challenging task ahead of them. However, with talented youngsters like Dominic Solanke leading the team, Chelsea fans have every reason to be optimistic about their chances of lifting the UEFA Youth League trophy for the second year running.",0,cnn_gpt4,0

1544,"Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), has been shown to significantly improve overall survival for patients with advanced melanoma. Since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011, there have been several clinical updates on the use of ipilimumab in the treatment of advanced melanoma. 1. Combination therapy: Combining ipilimumab with other immunotherapeutic agents, such as anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors like nivolumab and pembrolizumab, has demonstrated improved response rates compared to monotherapy. A phase III trial (CheckMate-067) showed that the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab resulted in improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared with ipilimumab alone or nivolumab alone. 2. Adjuvant therapy: Adjuvant ipilimumab therapy has been studied in resected stage III melanoma patients. The phase III EORTC 18071 trial demonstrated a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival in patients receiving ipilimumab compared to placebo. 3. Optimizing dosing and schedules: Newer clinical trials have explored different dosages, durations, and schedules of ipilimumab administration to optimize efficacy and minimize side effects. For instance, reducing the dose of ipilimumab when given in combination with nivolumab may result in a better safety profile without compromising treatment benefits. 4. Predictive biomarkers: Identifying biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to benefit from ipilimumab treatment remains an ongoing area of research. Factors like baseline tumor size, early changes in tumor burden, and immune-related gene signatures may help select patients more likely to respond to the therapy. 5. Managing immune-related adverse events: Clinical experience has led to improved management strategies for ipilimumab's immune-related adverse events (irAEs), such as rash, diarrhea, hepatitis, and hypophysitis. Early recognition and the use of immunosuppressive medications like corticosteroids or other immune-modulating drugs have helped manage these side effects while maintaining treatment efficacy. In conclusion, ipilimumab has significantly impacted the treatment of advanced melanoma, with ongoing research focused on optimizing its use, minimizing side effects, and identifying predictive biomarkers for optimal patient selection.",0,pubmed_gpt4,0

1077,"I bought this movie for 99 cents at K-mart several years back (along with ""Hawken's Breed figuring anything with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahoe is surely worth that much. Boy, was I in for a surprise. The film, titled ""The Mesmerizing Mystery,"" chronicles the life of a magician (Byrne) whose foray into the world of illusion has severe consequences when his magic act embroils him in a scandalous murder mystery. While the premise sounds promising, the execution of the movie left a lot to be desired. The plot seemed convoluted at times and failed to hold my attention throughout. This might be a result of a disorganized script or simply a shortfall in the director's vision. Byrne and Donahoe, despite being powerhouse actors, couldn't salvage this sinking ship of a film, and their performances were nothing more than passable. On the positive side, the movie had some spectacular cinematography, with a few stunningly shot scenes that kept me engaged. The soundtrack was also quite enjoyable, featuring a blend of haunting melodies and suspenseful tunes which somewhat elevated the overall experience. In conclusion, ""The Mesmerizing Mystery"" was a disappointing venture that didn't live up to the potential of its talented cast.

1487,"Yes, hubs with network motifs can organize modularity dynamically in the protein-protein interaction network of yeast. In such networks, hubs represent highly connected proteins, and network motifs are recurring patterns of interconnections. These hubs and motifs play crucial roles in the organization, stability, and functionality of the protein interaction network. A study by Han et al., published in Nature, 2004, titled ""Evidence for dynamically organized modularity in the yeast protein-protein interaction network"" found that hubs in the yeast protein-protein interaction network could be classified into two types: ""party"" hubs that interact with most of their partners simultaneously, and ""date"" hubs that bind different partners at different times or locations. They found that date hubs were often associated with network motifs and showed dynamic behavior, organizing modularity in the protein interaction network. These dynamic hubs enable the network to be adaptable and responsive to changes in environmental conditions or cellular processes. Furthermore, the modularity in protein-protein interaction networks contributes to the robustness of the system, allowing for efficient cellular functioning and adaptability. By organizing modularity dynamically, hubs with network motifs help the network effectively coordinate different modules within the cellular system and maintain overall network stability.",0,pubmed_gpt4,0
1459,"There is no direct evidence or research available that indicates mentors would decrease compliance with best sterile practices during central venous catheter placement in the trauma resuscitation unit. In general, mentors are experienced healthcare professionals who are trained to provide guidance and supervision to less experienced staff. Their role typically includes ensuring proper adherence to best practices, including sterile practices, to promote a safe environment for both the patient and healthcare provider. Some studies have shown that supervision, training, and feedback from experienced personnel can actually lead to improved compliance with best sterile practices. Therefore, we could assume that, in general, mentors would be more likely to positively influence compliance with practices such as central venous catheter placement in the trauma resuscitation unit. However, it is vital to consider that the effectiveness of a mentor's guidance or supervision may vary depending on the mentor's experience, communication skills, and the mentee's willingness to learn and comply with protocols.

1433,"Yes, joint fluid antioxidants are generally decreased in osteoarthritic joints compared to joints with macroscopically intact cartilage and subacute injury. Osteoarthritis is characterized by the degradation of cartilage and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS can cause oxidative stress, which can further damage the cartilage, leading to the progression of osteoarthritis. In normal joints, antioxidant systems help to neutralize the ROS and protect the cartilage from oxidative damage. However, in osteoarthritic joints, the antioxidant defense system can be compromised, leading to decreased levels of joint fluid antioxidants and an imbalance between the production of ROS and the capacity of the joint to neutralize them. Several studies have shown that lower levels of antioxidants, such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase are found in the synovial fluid of osteoarthritic joints compared to joints with intact cartilage and subacute injury. This reduction in antioxidants can contribute to increased oxidative stress and cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis, leading to more joint pain and loss of function.",0,pubmed_gpt4,0

20,"Lionel Messi is not the best player in the world, neither is Cristiano Ronaldo - that title belongs to Paris Saint-Germain forward Javier Pastore, according to Eric Cantona. Making a rare foray into discussing football matters, Manchester United legend Cantona delivered his surprising verdict that the Argentine was the 'most creative' player in the world. 'The best player in the world, the most exciting player in the world, is [Javier] Pastore from Paris Saint-Germain,' said Cantona, 'Why? Because I watched two games just to see Pastore playing, giving passes. He has got something special. Because football is interactive, it's why football is so popular, I think.' Javier Pastore (right) celebrates after winning the French League Cup with PSG last Saturday . The Argentina international is the best player in the world, according to former striker Eric Cantona . The former Manchester United forward was speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai . Pastore, who cost the French league leaders 29million, has three goals and five assists this season compared with Messi's 45 goals for Barcelona and Cristiano Ronaldo's 51 for Spanish rivals Real Madrid. But statistics did not colour Cantona's assessment. 'Pastore can do things that the other ones don't know, he does things that surprise you every time. Not only in scoring goals, spectacular goals - everything. Just passing. He's a very creative player. He's the most creative player, I think, in the world today. It's why I think he's the best player in the world, because I love this kind of player.' Cantona was third in the Ballon d'Or in 1993 behind Roberto Baggio and Dennis Bergkamp. He won the Premier League four times with United before retiring from playing aged 30. No stranger to prompting debate, Cantona invited more controversy by suggesting Spain had only won the World Cup because of the influence of Barcelona on the national team. Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned the best player in the world for 2014 at the award ceremony in January . The Real Madrid forward has scored 51 goals in all competitions this season . Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has also been overlooked by Cantona despite netting 45 times this season . 'Catalonia won the World Cup,' said Cantona, speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai. 'Spain won it with 10 Barcelona players in the team. Spain did not win the World Cup, Catalonia did. Barcelona won it. 'My grandparents are from Catalunya, from Barcelona. They arrived in France in '39. There was a civil war. So, I am very proud of Barcelona and all that they have done. 'I'm sure that as soon as the youth set-up from Barcelona and other Spanish teams draw new, good players, Spain will emerge again.'",1,cnn_human,0
943,"Not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series, I expected this film to merely accomplish the basic: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics, present a plot, and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel. And that's exactly what this movie happens to deliver.However, unlike with most other comic book movies, I felt that this one did it with a bit of class. Risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes, ""Blade"" presents a very modern, believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dreadas minor as it may have beenfrom a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional (i.e., sappy) aspect is concerned.Yes, the movie has innumerable plotholes, and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years. But when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie, and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this, what else matters? It may run a little long, but for what it sets out to do, ""Blade"" stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre.",1,imdb_human,1

Almost everything was voice over commentary to carry the story. The scriptwriter forgot that sometimes less is more and tried to explain several millennium of detailed history in the voice over. At the same time he forgot to do any character development. Most science fiction fans don't require huge amounts of character development, but it would be nice to know why the two main characters who survived the destruction of the space fleet together ended up fighting each other. There are some good things going on in the film. The soundtrack was well done. Some of the computer generated graphics are very good, but others were just mediocre.",1,imdb_human,0

Life on which planet, exactly? It's written about ""working-class"" characters, as imagined by middle-class people who have taken a course in creative writing. Eager to show to their middle-class peers how familiar they are with the ""working-class"" they dream up the lumpen rabble that is the citizenry of Eastenders.This has a toxic effect on some minds less well-equipped than others to handle fiction, and so we find members of the real population assuming the attitudes and demeanour of the inhabitants of Walford.Thus, it came to pass that Eastenders mirrors life; but only after life had been hoodwinked into mirroring Eastenders.Other soaps have followed in EE's footsteps, filled to their stinking gunwhales with ugly, potato-faced, shaven-headed, pot-bellied characters, scowling at each other and issuing threats constantly. This is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this trash. The writers will grow rich on the proceeds of such output, and will go on to enjoy the finer things of life in their rarified enclaves.

10,"(CNN) He's been part of a wildly popular superhero team since its very beginning. But there's something we never knew about Bobby Drake, aka Iceman of the X-Men. Wednesday's issue of ""All-New X-Men"" No. 40 reveals the truth: Bobby is gay. ""There are thousands if not millions of stories of people who, for many different reasons, felt the need to hide their sexuality,"" Brian Michael Bendis, who wrote the issue, said in a statement to CNN. ""The X-Men, with the conceit of time travel, give us a fascinating platform in which to examine such personal journeys. This is just the first little chapter of a much larger story that will be told."" Iceman's outing happens in an unusual manner. In the ""All-New X-Men"" storyline, members of the X-Men team travel to the past, as younger versions of themselves. Mind-reading mutant Jean Grey (also an X-Men original) asks Bobby why he calls women ""hot,"" when she knows he is gay. In comic book pages provided to CNN, Bobby doesn't immediately acknowledge that she is telling the truth. The character of Iceman is perhaps best known for his appearances in many of the ""X-Men"" films, as well as the 1981 animated series ""Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends."" The ""X-Men"" series of comics have long been progressive in terms of diversity, with a black female character, Storm, appearing in the 1970s, and the first gay mainstream comic book character, Northstar (who later married in the pages). DC Comics has also had prominent gay characters in recent years, like Batwoman and the original Green Lantern of Earth 2. Catwoman recently came out as bisexual, and Harley Quinn is portrayed that way as well. Bendis further shared his thoughts on Twitter about the attention surrounding the story when it leaked on Tuesday: ""i swear on my dogs, i wanted the issue to come out and just be. no press. no sensational headlines. no leaks. oh, well...""",1,cnn_human,0

""Our fighters will not evacuate from the main cities or the government institutions,"" rebel leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said in a televised address. ""Anyone who thinks we will surrender is dreaming."" His comments came after more than three weeks of Saudi-led coalition bombings aimed at pushing back the Houthis, who surged into the capital of Sanaa in January and ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power. Hadi still claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. Since mid-March, more than 700 people have been killed in violence that shows no sign of slowing, according to figures from the World Health Organization. The Houthis say they have the support of the country's people behind them. ""It's the right of the Yemeni people to stand against the attacks in all possible means as long as the attacks continue,"" Al-Houthi said Sunday. ""After our people move and react against the attacks and killing of children and women, we do not want to hear any voices and cries."" But there are signs of some fracturing among forces loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, many of whom have fought alongside the rebels. Gen. AbdulRahman AlHalili, who leads more than 10,000 troops, has now allied himself with Hadi, military sources said Sunday. Meanwhile, Saudi Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri said Sunday that airstrikes had decimated the Houthis' central command by targeting their communications. The rebels, he said, are now holding a defensive stance in besieged areas.

With the Charite (5 DOF), the IAR was less variable, yet the facet forces tended to increase, particularly during lateral bending.

From the contrasting landscapes, to the tightly enclosed world that the hero inhabits, we are taken by the Director and controlled from the very moment we enter the hotel. We, like the hero, will never escape from the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of his criminally driven, Mafia world.

The concrete grave, the inevitable brutal executions and overwhelming maleness are laid bare and exposed for what they are. Just brutality and business, and no more. Life is about being part of the corporate machine that is organised crime and not about love or living for self, family or others. Our hero is indeed a hero in that he gives up his life for the sake of the touch of the beautiful barmaid, the resolution of the misery suffered by his only neighbours in the hotel and in order to escape his decorative prison.

1335,"Our data suggest that reproduction does not significantly reduce the predatory efficiency of gravid C. sculpturatus, and that these females can cope with increasing body mass and the physiological costs of gestation. However, the observation that brooding females and females 24 hours FOR did not catch prey within the trial period indicates that maternal care significantly reduces predatory efficiency in these scorpions. Females 28 days FOR were still not as efficient at catching prey as non-gravid and gravid females, suggesting that reproductive costs extend for at least 4 weeks after the end of the maternal care period. Preferential use of an active foraging strategy by brooding females may increase prey encounter rates, allowing the scorpions to more rapidly replenish energy reserves depleted during reproduction. However, active foraging may be energetically costly and increase predation risk for brooding females. Our findings regarding antagonistic interactions between reproduction and feeding in female C. sculpturatus demonstrate the pervasive nature of reproductive costs for viviparous females, and may provide insight on factors that influence the diversity of reproductive strategies observed in nature.",1,pubmed_human,1

A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less. Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc. Person1: Well, that seems easy enough. Person2: Wait, there is more! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. What they are and how they are different from competitors? Then comes the hard part, a market analysis. You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea. Person1: Geez. Is that all? Person2: Almost, the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis. Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits. After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment! Person1: Umm. I think I ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business!",1,dialogsum_human,0

850,"Well, for this abomination of a film, I wasn't expecting anything good. I find Steve Carell annoying, and Bruce Almighty was pretty good but there is absolutely no reason for it to have a sequel. Somehow, this film was even lower than my expectations, even when I didn't have any. Does anyone remember the Disney movie Noah with Tony Danza? Well, let's just say that Evan Almighty completely ripped it off in way too many ways for the movie to remain justifiable. Actually Evan Almighty was had the EXACT same plot outline as Noah, with the exception of a few technicalities, it was nothing but a carbon copy of a far-superior movie that was actually FUNNY. Another thing, did anyone get sick of Wanda Sykes' stupid, unfunny, redundant, one-liners that were literally in every single scene? It was completely ridiculous and just dragged the movie down more and more. Despite the fact that I basically had already seen the film ten years earlier (Noah), Evan Almighty has to be the most predictable movie I've ever seen. I figured out the entire movie from beginning to end within the first five minutes and eventually realized that it was ripping off Noah left and right. In conclusion, if you're a little bit unsure of whether or not you want to see Evan Almighty, and are already sick of Jonah Hill playing the same role in every single movie he's in, liked Bruce Almighty, and don't want to see a predictable, dry, unfunny movie with Steve Carell trying to act like Jim Carrey, then please, don't see this piece of garbage.",1,imdb_human,1
912,"I watched this movie with big expectations. The blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be a nasty one. But it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfying. The violence was nothing I haven't seen a thousand times before, the gore level was only average (mind you there was probably more than what has been seen in Hollywood in the last 5 years - perhaps more), and at no stage was I even feeling uneasy let along frightened. Again a CAT 3 movie with big wraps, has not lived up to its hype.Sure hire this movie, but don't go in with any expectations. I am so keen to get into the whole Asian horror scene, but am continuously disappointed.

We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a chance. Well I should have went with my instincts. It was a complete piece Hollywood trash. Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good. Aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a moth eaten script. It's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries. It jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction. This is then compounded with, ............................yes I'll say it, BAD ACTING! I couldn't help but feel like I was watching ""Coffee Talk"" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was the Cat intended to be a middle aged Jewish woman?

199,"A Georgia road about 125 miles away from where Duane Allman died nearly 45 years ago took the life of one of the Southern rockers who played on the hit dedicated to the Allman Brothers guitarist. The former drummer and a founding member of the Southern hard rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, Robert 'Bob' Burns Jr, died late Friday in a single-vehicle crash near Cartersville, Georgia. Burns' vehicle went off the road just before midnight as it approached a curve, striking a mailbox and a tree, Georgia State Patrol spokeswoman Tracey Watson said. The former drummer of the Southern hard rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, Robert 'Bob' Burns Jr, died late Friday . Burns' vehicle went off a road just before midnight as it approached a curvenear Cartersville, Georgia . Burns was one of five people who founded the band in Jacksonville, Florida, and played on its first two albums . Burns, 64, was killed in the wreck. He was not wearing a seatbelt. Cartersville is about a two hour drive away from where Allman was killed after he crashed his motorcycle into a truck outside of Macon, Georgia, when he was just 24. After Allman's untimely death. the members ofLynyrd Skynyrd dedicated their song Free Bird to his memory. Burns was one of five musicians who founded the band in Jacksonville, Florida, and played on its first two albums. While Burns was with the group, it recorded other hits like Sweet Home Alabama, Gimme Three Steps, Simple Man and Don't Ask Me No Questions. Cartersville is about 125 miles away from Macon, Georgia, where Duane Allman died in a 1971 motorcycle crash . He left the group in 1974 because he was 'overwhelmed by life on the road', theCartersville Patch reported. Burns continued to play for fun or in guest appearances nationally, said his father, Robert Burns Sr. Early on, the group played in the Burns' family garage. Three other band members were previously killed in a plane crash in 1977. The elder Burns said: 'He was a product of his mother, so far as manners is concerned. 'He had the manners that would suit the King of England. 'Very soft-spoken and extremely well-mannered person to come out of that kind of industry.' The single-vehicle accident remains under investigation and weather may have played a factor.",1,cnn_human,0
881,"Before going any further, I have to admit that I only saw the first episode of this show. If I had the time, I might have considered watching it every week, if only to see how the season played out. However, it was very clear to me from the beginning that Martha Stewart's version of ""The Apprentice"" just doesn't ""fit in."" Martha Stewart made a career of being a happy homemaker, a domestic diva of the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child. It was only since her scandalous legal troubles and subsequent incarceration that her public image began to reflect the true roughness of her character. Sure, she was compelling for a while, and this entire series poses the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business. Does she have to come off as cold and tough? Shouldn't she?But the truth was, by the time Stewart came out of prison, her attempts for a public comeback, though certainly warranted, were never going to seize viewers' interest for very long. Perhaps a true comeback would have worked had she returned home peacefully and waited a year or so after her often mocked ankle bracelet was removed. Instead, she frantically dove into overkill with 2 series at once, the other being her syndicated daytime series Martha, much like her old show, but more mainstream, with famous guests like Bette Midler. Of course, even at her peak Stewart was never mainstream, so it's too much to ask that American audiences immediately accept her foray into reality TV. Maybe America wants Stewart to make a comeback on her own rather than be the basis for it.The show was basically a tired retread of Trump's ""Apprentice,"" which still holds my interest, depending on the tasks, the cast, and Trump's firing decisions (often controversial - likely for that reason). The letter bit was certainly not cliche but obnoxious in the least. The fact that Stewart never says, ""You're fired!"" - mentioned in the message board on this site - is particularly distressing. Producer Mark Burnett should be admired for dealing with Stewart's jail time honestly while trying to make her a hero, but the truth is that anyone watching can tell that she's basically trying to put on a show of being this nice businesswoman. Again never mainstream, Stewart lacks the agreeability and identifiability of Oprah Winfrey and the admirable, charismatic ""toughness"" of Donald Trump. Yes, this can be a gender-biased assessment of her character, but I mean it to be more about the nature of her business.It comes as no shock that Stewart has been fired, but I wonder if they really always intended it to only last for one season?",1,imdb_human,1

99,"What if they come fifth? Manchester City may have big plans to revamp the team in the summer, with Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri among the high-profile casualties, but what if Liverpool reel them in over the next six matches? City are four points clear and have a superior goal difference, which equates to five, yet undoubtedly they are vulnerable. For a team playing this poorly no run-in is easy and matches against the much-improved Aston Villa and even Queens Park Rangers can no longer be viewed with certainty. Yaya Toure (centre) has been a shadow of the player who fired Manchester City to last season's title . Manuel Pellegrini (second right) trudges off the pitch after Manchester City were beaten by Crystal Palace . Future opponents Swansea City and Southampton have little to play for - yet neither did Crystal Palace. The long-term plan is plain: Pep Guardiola, at his convenience, probably in 2016. Yet where will City be by then? An overhaul of playing personnel is due, but there has been scant evidence Manuel Pellegrini or director of football Txiki Begiristain are adept at identifying replacements. Eliaquim Mangala was supposed to be a different class to Joleon Lescott, but the Premier League's most expensive defender cannot command a place in the team; Stevan Jovetic is no Carlos Tevez; Fernando no great upgrade on Gareth Barry or Nigel de Jong. Toure is in obvious decline, but his influence on City's two title winning seasons was huge. Can Pellegrini and Begiristain be trusted to find a replacement capable of Toure's impact? Not on the evidence of their recent signings. Jesus Navas? Martin Demichelis? Even Fernandinho is not as good as he was at Shakhtar Donetsk. The powers that be at City are waiting for Pep Guardiola to leave Bayern Munich for Manchester . And what if City are caught and condemned to the Europa League? What happens to this lavish rebuilding plan then? Take away the Champions League money and City's financial capacity is not really much greater than Tottenham's. Pellegrini has performed weakly this season and keeping him on another year while marking time for Guardiola is a giant gamble. Roberto Mancini got City into the elite in the nick of time with the financial fair play regulations about to be introduced. Locked outside, City's capacity to improve would be severely limited. Would Guardiola even come in those circumstances? Great manager he may be, but not one that has shown any burning desire to work off the same budget as Everton.",1,cnn_human,1

770,"So far I disliked every single Jean Rollin movie I've seen, and that always bothered me because he's an acclaimed Euro-trash monument and extremely popular amongst many regular reviewers on this lovely website; people whose opinions I always value and usually concur with. Apparently everybody always appears to pinpoint some sort of gloomy and stylistic filming trademarks in his work that are completely lost on me. Rollin's movies are unimaginably boring, they all feature the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in various settings), the dialogs are incredibly absurd, the marvelous Gothic setting are always underused and the production values are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket. I had actually given up on Rollin's repertoire already (especially after enduring ""The Iron Rose, until I found out about ""Night of the Hunted."" Allegedly, this movie doesn't feature any lame lesbian vampires and stands as a bona fide horror movie with gruesome killings and macabre plot twists. And the verdict is yes and no! On one hand, this is undeniably the most compelling and inventive Rollin film I had the pleasure of seeing thus far (and also the only one that I watching without dozing off). On the other hand, it still remains a moronic movie with a nonsensical plot and emotionless sex sequences to compensate for the dullness. Jean Rollin heavily attempts to generate an atmosphere of secrecy and suspense, mostly through a lack of information and vaguely introduced characters, but barely manages to hide the fact he actually hasn't got a story to tell at all. The unearthly beautiful lead actress Brigitte Lahaie and the beautifully ominous musical guidance are the only elements that keep you hooked on the screen. During a nightly drive back home to Paris, a young man abruptly has to stop for a confused and scarcely dressed girl who comes running from the woods. Her name is Elisabeth but furthermore she can't remember anything about herself and from what or whom she was running away. Her case of amnesia is so bad she even continuously forgets who picked her up. The next day, she's kidnapped again by an old guy and taken to a sinister apartment complex where multiple people in the same bizarre mental state are held captive. Elisabeth knows nothing, but she does sense she needs to escape from here. Obviously I won't reveal the denouement, but I can assure you it is quite dumb, illogical and far-fetched. Apparently Rollin realized this as well, because the explanation is kept very brief and quick. There's a large number of overly weird and senseless sequences, the sex footage is dire and filmed without passion, the nasty make-up effects look cheap and randomly thrown without actual purpose. As said, the score is mesmerizing and Brigitte Lahaie's perfect body is addictive to glaze at.",1,imdb_human,1

Chelsea made two changes from the side that started the quarter-final victory over Atletico Madrid last month, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Charly Musonda coming into the line-up. Andreas Christensen, who started in midfield against Atletico, was paired with Jake Clarke-Salter at centre-back, while Ola Aina and Jay DaSilva occupied the full-back positions. Loftus-Cheek was partnered in midfield by Colkett and Musonda, with the latter operating in the hole behind the front-three of Solanke, Jeremie Boga and captain Izzy Brown.

The first came at the end of a driving run from Brown, which saw the ball bounce kindly into the path of Colkett for him to wrong-foot the goalkeeper with an awkward shot. A second goal followed from Christensen's excellent long ball forward, met by the run of Solanke who rounded the rushing keeper to fire into an empty net. After Boga had an attempt spilled by the keeper, Solanke was on hand to poach his second and Chelsea's third.

948,"Fires on the plain directed by Kon Ichikawa and written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada is a World War two movie which is finally not showing the allies fighting the axis powers, but the Japanese fighting and struggling for their lives on the Philippines. The main characters name is Tamura , played by Eiji Funakoshi, and he is a soldier leaving his regiment because of him being sick. All he has on him is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes. Like this, he is trying to make his way to the hospital in order to get a doctor and a cure for his disease. But since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed, he begins a long walk. Throughout the whole movie, Tamura remains a bit cowardish, but very civil, when the other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for survival Tamura is still remaining human and would not degrade. A scene which has influenced me a lot to think positively and different about this war movie is, when Tamura comes into a Phillipino village which is completely deserted. There, he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of Japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church. This makes Tamura think and even more scared than he already is. That shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine, but a servant to higher beings and human most importantly. After he turns away from the corpses, two Phillipinos (a couple or brother and sister: very close relationship) return to the village in order to get their stash of salt back. The main character of the movie wants to be friendly at first, although he walked up to them with his gun, but shoots the woman once she starts screaming. Her brotherboyfriendhusband then runs away in fear and after a moment Tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing Filipino. He does not hit him. After Tamura picks up the bag of salt , something very precious , he drops his gun into a river. This gesture is very important in order to understand Kon Ichikawa'sShohei Ooka's profiling of Tamura and the war. Comparing this movie to other World War 2 movies, it is not typical at all. Of course all movies have suffering heroes, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. He expresses everything that is human: he is getting manipulated , he is weak , he gets scared , he has hope. This is typical for Japanese World War two movies and for Japanese society. Since World War two is not a discussed theme in Japanese society, Japanese are likely to put Japanese in the second World War in the role of the victim. This victimisation is also very visual in this movie. One of the examples is Tamura, another one the piled up bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one is, when the Japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street and the Americans are already waiting there for them and shooting all of the Japanese soldiers which have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no health equipment or anything alike. In my personal conclusion I have to say that it is worth seeing this film in order to finally see a movie from the other side than usual. It also has no nationalistic propaganda which could've been easily built in. Once you have watched the movie fully, you will be able to see the horrors of the second World War to its total extent.",1,imdb_human,1
876,"Leaving aside the drawbacks and deficiencies of the film mentioned by other viewers I must say that it seemed to me a film about power,which is in my opinion one of the most luring illusions. I saw the drama of an emperor and people. It seems to me that the director wanted to pose a question of what the benefit of nation is and what the price of ""happiness"" for all is. Is there justification for the enforced benefit and ""happiness""? How much can be forfeited for the nation's security and peaceful existence? Is the idea of a powerful would-be empire worth reducing to misery and killing thousands of its citizens now? It seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and seeks to learn it all the time the film runs. He is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically harassed by the discovery of his true origin. He seems to half hate his subjects for having to renounce his father and his love, half love the people as a good emperor should. No wonder his actions are controversial and emotions confused. It seems to me that as another film presenting the problem of power of man over other men the film is a success.",1,imdb_human,1
95,"Listeners say the last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions on the iPlayer service . It seems that the BBC has lost the plot with its radio dramas. Frustrated listeners say the vital last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions uploaded to the iPlayer service. They branded the problem 'irritating', 'annoying' and 'frustrating' and said it was ruining their enjoyment of the programmes. Shows such as Dad's Army and Hancock's Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. It says the live sections of radio stations cause the start and end times of programmes to shift, confusing the automatic recording system. But this is not a new problem for the corporation and has been on its radar for at least three years. It was raised by the BBC's own Feedback programme in February 2012 but, with the issue still persisting now, listeners have been forced to again approach the Radio 4 programme, which deals with audience complaints. One said: 'Do you have any idea how irritating, annoying, frustrating it is to attempt to listen again [to a programme] only for the last few minutes to be cut off? 'All because you can't be bothered to check that whole show was there. Please, if you are going to make available a programme I have missed can I have the whole programme?' Another added: 'I enjoy radio drama immensely but just recently I have found that some final episodes have last the vital few minutes. I was simply left hanging in the air at a very crucial stage.' Shows such as Dad's Army and Hancock's Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes . According to the BBC's own figures, in February this year, 57million 'requests' were made for radio programmes on BBC iPlayer. Each request means a person chose to listen to a show. Of this number, one quarter were people listening to programmes on catch-up, a jump from one in five the previous month. As the use of catch-up becomes increasingly popular, more people will suffer from shows missing their final moments. Andrew Scott, General Manager of the BBC's Audience Facing Services, appeared on Feedback and apologised for the problem and said they are now adding two minutes to the end of all its recordings in an attempt to stamp out the problem. He told the programme: 'There are a lot of shows every week that are made available on demand and we simply can't humanly check every single one of those, so what we are trying to do is make sure we have the very best fail safe systems in place.'",1,cnn_human,1
